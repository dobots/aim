# Dodedodo - Artificial Intelligence for you!

[Dodedodo](http://www.dodedodo.com/) is an "internet of things" infrastructure. More than other software packages it provides machine learning and artificial intelligence algorithms for everyone to use in their applications. Why the internet of things? We would like answer that question with a few questions of our own:

* Why would you want to come home to a cold house?
* Why would you want to turn on the lights yourself?
* Why would you want to forget to turn off the heating?
* Why would you want to clean your house yourself?
* Why would you not want to know if your grandma fell?
* Why would you not want to know if there is a burglar in your home?
* Why would you want to have dead plants?
* Why would you not want to find out that your dog hurt itself by accident?
* Why do you want to forget groceries in the supermarket?
* Why do you want to forget your suitcase in the train?

The need of new technology might not always be visible beforehand, however, actively withholding yourself from technology might have undesired side-effects. We want to give you the power of this type of pervasive technology. You want to be able to use those services, and you want to decide where your data goes, and how to process it. We would like to take you on a journey with us, to enable you to do so.

## Infrastructure

The Dodedodo infrastructure exists out of a rich toolset. It is not created as a stand-alone library or a single API and it must much more be seen as an ecosystem. It takes its inspiration from robotic platforms such as [YARP](http://eris.liralab.it/yarp) (Yet Another Robot Platform) and [ROS](http://www.ros.org) (Robot Operating System), from online application repositories such as [Google play](https://play.google.com) and [Launchpad](https://launchpad.net/~dobots/+archive/ppa).

The Dodedodo infrastructure consists of:

* A visual, web-based **drag-and-drop interface** at [www.dodedodo.com](http://www.dodedodo.com/)
* An infrastructure for **real-time streaming** between devices (using at this moment XMPP).
* An application (coined rur-builder) that allows you to run the same code on **Android, Raspberry PI, Docker, or Ubuntu** and which also allows you a wide set of **communication schemes** (middlewares) on those platforms.
* A tool set for **module management and scheduling**. 

The code can be found at [AIM on GitHub](https://github.com/dobots/aim).
